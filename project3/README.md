## IT3105 Artificial Intelligence Programming - Project 3

This project focused on the implementation of neural networks using the numerical computation library [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) for Python 3.4.

[Module 5](https://github.com/pmitche/it3105-aiprogramming/tree/master/project3/module5) is the classic introductory task of neural networks; classifying hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset.

[Module 6](https://github.com/pmitche/it3105-aiprogramming/tree/master/project3/module6) uses neural networks to play the 2048 game by training on datasets generated by our Expectimax implementation from [module 4](https://github.com/pmitche/it3105-aiprogramming/tree/master/project2). The primary focus for this module was to create a representation of board states and heuristics that would prove satisfiable to train a neural network well enough to get a decent score (at the very least better than a random player).
